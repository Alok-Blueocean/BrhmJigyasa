The sounding of the transcendental conchshells indicated that there was no hope of victory for the other side because Kåñëa was on the side of the Päëòavas. Jayas tu päëòu-puträëäà yeñäà pakñe janärdanaù. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 6) [BG 1.14p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 7) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 8) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 9) \t1)\t<Q>What were the signs of victory on Pandavas even before the beginning of the Kurukshetra war  - 1?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 10) <A>Victory is always with persons like the sons of Päëòu because Lord Kåñëa is associated with them. And whenever and wherever the Lord is present, the goddess of fortune is also there because the goddess of fortune never lives alone without her husband. Therefore, victory and fortune were awaiting Arjuna, as indicated by the transcendental sound produced by the conchshell of Viñëu, or Lord Kåñëa. Besides that, the chariot on which both the friends were seated had been donated by Agni (the fire-god) to Arjuna, and this indicated that this chariot was capable of conquering all sides, wherever it was drawn over the three worlds. </A> </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 11) [BG 1.14p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 12) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 13) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 14) \t1)\t<Q>Why is Lord Krishna called as Hrishikesha ? How does this refute Mayavadi conception?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 15) <A>Lord Kåñëa is referred to as Håñékeça in this verse because He is the owner of all senses. The living entities are part and parcel of Him, and therefore the senses of the living entities are also part and parcel of His senses. The impersonalists cannot account for the senses of the living entities, and therefore they are always anxious to describe all living entities as senseless, or impersonal. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 16) [BG 1.15p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 17) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 18) \t1)\t<Q>How does Lord get His names ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 19) <A>The Lord has different names according to His different activities. For example, His name is Madhusüdana because He killed the demon of the name Madhu; His name is Govinda because He gives pleasure to the cows and to the senses; His name is Väsudeva because He appeared as the son of Väsudeva; His name is Devaké-nandana because He accepted Devaké as His mother; His name is Yaçodä-nandana because He awarded His childhood pastimes to Yaçodä at Våndävana; His name is Pärtha-särathi because He worked as charioteer of His friend Arjuna. Similarly, His name is Håñékeça because He gave direction to Arjuna on the Battlefield of Kurukñetra. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 20) [BG 1.15p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 21) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 22) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 23) \t1)\t<Q>What were the signs of victory on Pandavas even before the beginning of the Kurukshetra war  - 2?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 24) <A>The emblem of Hanumän on the flag of Arjuna is another sign of victory because Hanumän cooperated with Lord Räma in the battle between Räma and Rävaëa, and Lord Räma emerged victorious. Now both Räma and Hanumän were present on the chariot of Arjuna to help him. Lord Kåñëa is Räma Himself, and wherever Lord Räma is, His eternal servitor Hanumän and His eternal consort Sétä, the goddess of fortune, are present. Therefore, Arjuna had no cause to fear any enemies whatsoever. And above all, the Lord of the senses, Lord Kåñëa, was personally present to give him direction. Thus, all good counsel was available to Arjuna in the matter of executing the battle. In such auspicious conditions, arranged by the Lord for His eternal devotee, lay the signs of assured victory. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 25) [BG 1.20p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 26) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 27) </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 28) \t1)\t<Q>How did Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna end up becoming the charioteer of Arjuna ?  </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 29) <A>Although Lord Kåñëa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of His causeless mercy He was engaged in the service of His friend. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 30) [BG 1.21-22p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 31) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 32) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 33) \t1)\t<Q>Why was Krishna called as Adokshaja (infallible) by Arjuna ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 34) <A>He never fails in His affection for His devotees, and thus He is addressed herein as infallible. As charioteer, He had to carry out the orders of Arjuna, and since He did not hesitate to do so, He is addressed as infallible. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 35) [BG 1.21-22p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 36) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 37) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 38) \t1)\t<Q>What made Krishna willing accept the post of a charioteer of Arjuna although He is undisputed master of the entire creation ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 39) <A>The relationship between the Lord and His servitor is very sweet and transcendental. The servitor is always ready to render service to the Lord, and, similarly, the Lord is always seeking an opportunity to render some service to the devotee. He takes greater pleasure in His pure devotee\'s assuming the advantageous position of ordering Him than He does in being the giver of orders. Since He is master, everyone is under His orders, and no one is above Him to order Him. But when He finds that a pure devotee is ordering Him, He obtains transcendental pleasure, although He is the infallible master in all circumstances. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 40) [BG 1.21-22p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 41) \t\t</Q>\xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 42) </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 43) \t1)\t<Q>Why is Arjuna addressed as Gudakesha ? </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 44) <A>In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Guòäkeça. Guòäkä means sleep, and one who conquers sleep is called guòäkeça. Sleep also means ignorance. So Arjuna conquered both sleep and ignorance because of his friendship with Kåñëa. As a great devotee of Kåñëa, he could not forget Kåñëa even for a moment, because that is the nature of a devotee. Either in waking or in sleep, a devotee of the Lord can never be free from thinking of Kåñëa\'s name, form, qualities and pastimes. Thus a devotee of Kåñëa can conquer both sleep and ignorance simply by thinking of Kåñëa constantly. This is called Kåñëa consciousness, or samädhi. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 45) [BG 1.24p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 46) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 47) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 48) \t1)\t<Q>What is the nature of a devotee ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 49) <A>In this verse Arjuna is referred to as Guòäkeça.

Thus He did so, and spoke as follows. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 55) [BG 1.24p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 56) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 57) </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 58) \t1)\t<Q>Why is Krishna addressed as Hrishikesha for placing the chariot in b/w the armies and why did Krishna address Arjuna as Partha ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 59) <A>As the Supersoul of all living entities, Lord Kåñëa could understand what was going on in the mind of Arjuna. The use of the word Håñékeça in this connection indicates that He knew everything. And the word Pärtha, meaning "the son of Påthä, or Kunté," is also similarly significant in reference to Arjuna. As a friend, He wanted to inform Arjuna that because Arjuna was the son of Påthä, the sister of His own father Vasudeva, He had agreed to be the charioteer of Arjuna. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 60) [BG 1.25p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 61) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 62) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 63) \t1)\t<Q>What did Krishna mean when he said to Arjuna "behold the Kurus" ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 64) <A>Now what did Kåñëa mean when He told Arjuna to "behold the Kurus"? Did Arjuna want to stop there and not fight? Kåñëa never expected such things from the son of His aunt Påthä. The mind of Arjuna was thus predicted by the Lord in friendly joking. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 65) [BG 1.25p]  </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 66) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 67) </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 68) \t1)\t<Q>Although Arjuna was willing to forgive the wrongdoings on him why did Krishna want Arjuna to fight the war ?</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 69) <A>As a natural devotee of the Lord, Arjuna did not like to retaliate against his miscreant cousins and brothers, but it was the Lord\'s plan that they should all be killed. The devotee of the Lord does not retaliate against the wrongdoer, but the Lord does not tolerate any mischief done to the devotee by the miscreants. The Lord can excuse a person on His own account, but He excuses no one who has done harm to His devotees. Therefore the Lord was determined to kill the miscreants, although Arjuna wanted to excuse them. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 70) [BG 1.32-35p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 71) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 72) </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 73) \t1)\t<Q>Why did Arjuna address Krishna as "MADHAVA" while trying to justify his unwillingness to fight ? </pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 74) <A>Arjuna\'s addressing of Kåñëa as "Mädhava," or the husband of the goddess of fortune, is also significant in this connection. He wanted to point out to Kåñëa that, as husband of the goddess of fortune, He should not induce Arjuna to take up a matter which would ultimately bring about misfortune. Kåñëa, however, never brings misfortune to anyone, to say nothing of His devotees. </A></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 75) [BG 1.36p]</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 76) \t\t</Q></pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 77) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 78) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 79) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 80) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 81) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 82) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 83) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 84) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 85) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 86) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 87) \xa0</pre><pre>(0, 0, 0, 88) [Bhagavad Gita 1.26p]</pre></td></tr></table></body></html>
